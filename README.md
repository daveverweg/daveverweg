- 👀 I’m interested in [Cosmology](https://www.sciencenews.org/topic/cosmology), [Mathematics](https://phys.org/science-news/mathematics/) and [Econometrics](https://www2.econ.osaka-u.ac.jp/~tanizaki/cv/books/cmse/cmse.pdf).
- 🌱 I’m currently studying [Relativistic Cosmology](http://strangebeautiful.com/other-texts/ellis-maartens-maccallum-relativistic-cosmo.pdf).
- 💞️ I’m looking to working on a project to forecast stocks by applying [wavelet decompositions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/wavelet-decomposition).
